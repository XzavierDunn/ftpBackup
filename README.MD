# FTP Server Backup

## Introduction

> I created this to backup my Minecraft server. Provide the username, password, and the folder you would like to install and it will recursively download all of the files.

## OS

> Currently only works on windows. I am missing some logic for Mac/Linux. Should come soon.

## Installation

1. Get clone https://github.com/XzavierDunn/ftpBackup.git
2. python3 -m venv venv
3. Activate venv => . ./venv/bin/activate/ or \venv\Scripts\Activate
4. pip install -r requirements or pip install click
5. python main.py --help to get started.
